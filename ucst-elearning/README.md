Sushi Chef script for importing ucst-elearning content

Kolibri is an open source educational platform to distribute content to areas with
little or no internet connectivity. Educational content is created and edited on [Kolibri Studio](https://studio.learningequality.org),
which is a platform for organizing content to import from the Kolibri applications. The purpose
of this project is to create a *chef*, or a program that scrapes a content source and puts it
into a format that can be imported into Kolibri Studio. 


## Installation

* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it already.

* Install [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) if you don't have it already.

* Create a Python virtual environment for this project (optional, but recommended):
   * Install the virtualenv package: `pip install virtualenv`
   * The next steps depends if you're using UNIX (Mac/Linux) or Windows:
      * For UNIX systems:
         * Create a virtual env called `venv` in the current directory using the
           following command: `virtualenv -p python3  venv`
         * Activate the virtualenv called `venv` by running: `source venv/bin/activate`.
           Your command prompt will change to indicate you're working inside `venv`.
      * For Windows systems:
         * Create a virtual env called `venv` in the current directory using the
           following command: `virtualenv -p C:/Python36/python.exe venv`.
           You may need to adjust the `-p` argument depending on where your version
           of Python is located.
         * Activate the virtualenv called `venv` by running: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required python libraries.


## Usage

    ./sushichef -v --reset --compress --token=".token"



## Description

A sushi chef script is responsible for importing content into Kolibri Studio.
The [Rice Cooker](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker) library provides
all the necessary methods for uploading the channel content to Kolibri Studio,
as well as helper functions and utilities.

A sushi chef script has been started for you in `sushichef.py`.

Sushi chef docs can be found [here](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker/blob/master/README.md).

_For more sushi chef examples, see `examples/openstax_sushichef.py` (json) and
 `examples/wikipedia_sushichef.py` (html) and also the examples/ dir inside the ricecooker repo._
